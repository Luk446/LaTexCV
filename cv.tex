\section*{About Me}
Robotics and machine learning engineer with a background in biomedical engineering. Currently studying for an \textbf{MSc in Robotics with Industrial Application} at Heriot-Watt University (expected 2027), working on end-to-end IoT systems, ML theory, ROS programming and robot kinematics. My undergraduate thesis focused on \textbf{automatic hyperparameter optimisation for an MLP regressor for prototype soft medical robotics}. I am looking for a 6-month industry placement where I can apply ML/controls skills on real robotic systems.
