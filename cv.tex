\section*{About Me}
Robotics and machine-learning engineer with a background in biomedical engineering. I am currently studying for an \textbf{MSc in Robotics with Industrial Application} at Heriot-Watt University (expected 2027), focusing on end-to-end IoT systems, machine-learning theory, ROS programming and robot kinematics. My undergraduate thesis investigated automatic hyperparameter optimisation of an MLP regressor for a prototype soft medical robot. I am seeking a six-month industry placement where I can apply machine-learning and control skills to real robotic systems.
